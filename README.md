# Responsible-AI-with-Azure-AI-Foundry

### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to apply Azure AI Foundry's default and custom content filters to ensure compliance with Responsible AI principles when working with generative AI models. Content filtering is a critical aspect of Responsible AI, helping to identify and prevent potentially harmful prompts and completions in interactions with AI services.

By leveraging Azure AI Foundry's tools, this project explores the effects of content filters and provides insight into implementing custom filtering mechanisms for specific generative AI scenarios.

### Business Applications

1. Generative AI in Customer Support
- Prevent inappropriate or harmful responses in chatbot interactions.

2. Educational Tools
- Filter content to ensure compliance with age-appropriate guidelines for AI-powered tutoring.

3. Content Creation Platforms
- Enforce ethical content generation by restricting offensive or harmful outputs.

4. Healthcare Applications
- Prevent misinformation or inappropriate medical advice in AI interactions.

### Features

1. Default Content Filters
- Predefined filters provided by Azure AI Foundry to identify and block harmful content.

2. Custom Content Filters
- Define custom filters for specific use cases with permission.
- Ensure Responsible AI principles are enforced in unique scenarios.

3. Support for Generative AI Scenarios
- Apply content filtering to mitigate risks associated with large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI systems.

#### Sample of How I Explored Content Filters

### Project Workflow

1. Set Up Azure AI Foundry
- Navigate to the Azure portal.
- Create a Foundry Resource under the Azure AI Services category.

2. Test Default Content Filters

Use Azure AI Foundry's tools to experiment with default filters:
- Submit various prompts to the AI model.
- Observe how the filters identify and block harmful content.

3. Implement Custom Content Filters
- Apply for permissions to define custom filters.
- Create rules to tailor content moderation for specific scenarios.

4. Monitor and Analyze Filter Performance
- Use Foundryâ€™s built-in analytics to track filter effectiveness.
- Adjust filtering rules as needed based on insights.

### What I Learned

- Responsible AI Principles: Understanding the importance of ethical AI practices and tools like content filtering to minimize risks.
- Azure AI Foundry: How it simplifies the application of Responsible AI practices in generative AI scenarios.
- Customizable Solutions: The ability to tailor content filtering for specific business needs ensures flexibility and effectiveness.

### Future Enhancements

- Integrate content filters into real-world applications, such as chatbots and virtual assistants.
- Evaluate the impact of filters on user experience and feedback.
- Explore additional Responsible AI practices, such as bias detection and mitigation in generative AI models.
